# Landing Page Project

This is my first major project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. The goal is to recreate a web page based on a provided design, using HTML and CSS.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Build an entire static web page from scratch.
- Match the provided design layout and visual structure.
- Practice and apply flexbox, spacing, font styling, and image handling in CSS.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Structuring a page using semantic HTML.
- Applying CSS for layout and styling.
- Using Flexbox for alignment and spacing.
- Debugging layout issues by inspecting elements.
- Practicing version control with Git and GitHub.

## 🎨 Customization

I was encouraged to personalize the content, so I:

- Swapped in real images instead of placeholders.
- Used my own color palette and fonts (within reason).
- Wrote original text instead of dummy content.

## 🛠️ How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🧾 Notes

Pixel-perfection was not required — the emphasis was on getting things "close enough" to the reference design. I also looked up new CSS properties like `border-radius` and `box-shadow` as needed.
